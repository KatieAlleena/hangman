# hangman
A hangman game created with Javascript for CanCode's Javascript Fundamentals Class Fall '22. First Project of the semester.

Change Log:
11/14/22 -- Initial Commit, package.json created. Created index.js. Copied over word-bank.js

11/28/22 -- Committing basic version of the game. Can't figure out a clean way to draw a hangman, so I've changed it to just letters for now.

11/30/22 -- Final updates!

Difficulties: 
1. Drawing a hangman in console that looks like a hangman?
Uh It's just turning out weird. 

2. I wanted to make the game tell me if I guessed the same letter I had guessed already ... but I confused myself, broke my game, and decided to leave that out. 

3. I would have rather had the game remind me to use letters if I input a symbol or a word or a number, but it just continues on. Since it's not broken, I'm deciding to leave it as is.

4. Answer lines aren't centered with the rest of the game text. It's weird. Sorry.

I've pulled as many links as I could remember researching out of my history and bookmarks and listed them here as frequently as I could remember to do so.

3. For a WHILE my game was broken, because I forgot to make a variable for the alphabet... research helped resolve this, and kept me from having to type that all out myself. Do I completely get it? NO. Absolutely not. But it WORKED.

4. Understanding the problem by seeing other people break it down. These weren't totally helpful, I still needed to look up a lot more as you'll see with the rest of these links, but still.
